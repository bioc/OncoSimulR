Description: Functions for simulating and plotting cancer progression
    data, including drivers and passengers, and allowing for order
    restrictions. Simulations use continuous-time models (based on Bozic
    et al., 2010 and McFarland et al., 2013) and fitness functions account
    for possible restrictions in the order of accumulation of mutations.
