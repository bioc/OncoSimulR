                   laboratory method to measure gains and losses of
                   chromosomal regions in tumor cells. It is believed
                   that DNA gains and losses in tumor cells do not occur
                   entirely at random, but partly through some flow of
                   causality. Models that relate tumor progression to
                   the occurrence of DNA gains and losses could be very
                   useful in hunting cancer genes and in cancer
                   diagnosis. We lay some mathematical foundations for
                   inferring a model of tumor progression from a CGH
                   data set. We consider a class of tree models that are
                   more general than a path model that has been
                   developed for colorectal cancer. We derive a tree
                   model inference algorithm based on the idea of a
                   maximum-weight branching in a graph, and we show that
                   under plausible assumptions our algorithm infers the
                   correct tree. We have implemented our methods in
                   software, and we illustrate with a CGH data set for

                   characterized by accumulating mutations. However, the
                   precise timing and the order of genetic alterations
                   that drive tumor progression remain enigmatic.
                   RESULTS: We present a specific probabilistic
                   graphical model for the accumulation of mutations and
                   their interdependencies. The Bayesian network models
                   cancer progression by an explicit unobservable
                   accumulation process in time that is separated from
                   the observable but error-prone detection of
                   mutations. Model parameters are estimated by an
                   Expectation-Maximization algorithm and the underlying
                   interaction graph is obtained by a simulated
                   annealing procedure. Applying this method to
                   cytogenetic data for different cancer types, we find
                   multiple complex oncogenetic pathways deviating
                   substantially from simplified models, such as linear
                   pathways or trees. We further demonstrate how the
                   inferred progression dynamics can be used to improve
                   genetics-based survival predictions which could
                   support diagnostics and prognosis. AVAILABILITY: The

                   aberrations. The data from tumors are cross-sectional
                   and do not contain the temporal order of the genetic
                   events. Finding the order in which the genetic events
                   have occurred and progression pathways are of vital
                   importance in understanding the disease. In order to
                   model cancer progression, we propose Progression
                   Networks, a special case of Bayesian networks, that
                   are tailored to model disease progression.
                   Progression networks have similarities with
                   Conjunctive Bayesian Networks (CBNs) [1],a variation
                   of Bayesian networks also proposed for modeling
                   disease progression. We also describe a learning
                   algorithm for learning Bayesian networks in general
                   and progression networks in particular. We reduce the
                   hard problem of learning the Bayesian and progression
                   networks to Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP).
                   MILP is a Non-deterministic Polynomial-time complete
                   (NP-complete) problem for which very good heuristics
                   exists. We tested our algorithm on synthetic and real
                   cytogenetic data from renal cell carcinoma. We also
                   compared our learned progression networks with the
                   networks proposed in earlier publications. The

                   dynamics can only be addressed through simulations.
                   However, accurate simulations of realistically large
                   populations over long periods of time needed for
                   evolution to proceed are computationally expensive.
                   Mutant can be present in very small numbers and yet
                   (if they are more fit than others) be the key part of
                   the evolutionary process. This leads to significant
                   stochasticity that needs to be accounted for.
                   Different evolutionary events occur at very different
                   time scales: mutations are typically much rarer than
                   reproduction and deaths. RESULTS: We introduce a new
                   exact algorithm for fast fully stochastic simulations
                   of evolutionary dynamics that include birth, death,
                   and mutation events. It produces a significant
                   speedup compared to the direct stochastic simulations
                   in a typical case when the population size is large
                   and the mutation rates are much smaller than birth
                   and death rates. The algorithm performance is
                   illustrated by several examples that include
                   evolution on a smooth and rugged fitness landscape.
                   We also show how this algorithm can be adapted for
                   approximate simulations of more complex evolutionary
                   problems and illustrate it by simulations of a
                   stochastic competitive growth model. CONTACT:

                   occurring throughout the world. Though the emerging
                   data from these studies are illuminating, their
                   reconciliation with epidemiologic and clinical
                   observations poses a major challenge. In the current
                   study, we provide a mathematical model that begins to
                   address this challenge. We model tumors as a discrete
                   time branching process that starts with a single
                   driver mutation and proceeds as each new driver
                   mutation leads to a slightly increased rate of clonal
                   expansion. Using the model, we observe tremendous
                   variation in the rate of tumor development-providing
                   an understanding of the heterogeneity in tumor sizes
                   and development times that have been observed by
                   epidemiologists and clinicians. Furthermore, the
                   model provides a simple formula for the number of
                   driver mutations as a function of the total number of
                   mutations in the tumor. Finally, when applied to
                   recent experimental data, the model allows us to
                   calculate the actual selective advantage provided by
                   typical somatic mutations in human tumors in situ.
                   This selective advantage is surprisingly small-0.004
                   ± 0.0004-and has major implications for experimental

  abstract =      {Cancer progression is driven by the accumulation of a
                   small number of genetic alterations. However, these
                   few driver alterations reside in a cancer genome
                   alongside tens of thousands of additional mutations
                   termed passengers. Passengers are widely believed to
                   have no role in cancer, yet many passengers fall
                   within protein-coding genes and other functional
                   elements that can have potentially deleterious
                   effects on cancer cells. Here we investigate the
                   potential of moderately deleterious passengers to
                   accumulate and alter the course of neoplastic
                   progression. Our approach combines evolutionary
                   simulations of cancer progression with an analysis of
                   cancer sequencing data. From simulations, we find
                   that passengers accumulate and largely evade natural
                   selection during progression. Although individually
                   weak, the collective burden of passengers alters the
                   course of progression, leading to several oncological
                   phenomena that are hard to explain with a traditional
                   driver-centric view. We then tested the predictions
                   of our model using cancer genomics data and confirmed
                   that many passengers are likely damaging and have
                   largely evaded negative selection. Finally, we use
                   our model to explore cancer treatments that exploit
                   the load of passengers by either (i) increasing the
                   mutation rate or (ii) exacerbating their deleterious
                   effects. Though both approaches lead to cancer
                   regression, the latter is a more effective therapy.
                   Our results suggest a unique framework for
                   understanding cancer progression as a balance of
                   driver and passenger mutations.},

                   provides a number of unexpected results. For rapidly
                   fluctuating environments, substitutions are more
                   regular than random. A small mutation-rate
                   approximation is used to explain the regularity. The
                   explanation does not depend heavily on the
                   particulars of the haploid model, leading to the
                   conjecture that many symmetrical models of molecular
                   evolution with rapidly changing parameters may
                   exhibit substitutions that are more regular than
                   random. When fitnesses change very slowly, the
                   simulation shows that substitutions are more clumped
                   than random. Here a small-mutation approximation
                   shows that the clustering is due to the increase in
                   fitness that accompanies each successive substitution
                   with a consequent lowering of the effective mutation
                   rate. The two observations taken together suggest
                   that the common observation that amino acid
                   substitutions are clustered in time is due to the

  abstract =      {The role of genetic instability in driving
                   carcinogenesis remains controversial. Genetic
                   instability should accelerate carcinogenesis by
                   increasing the rate of advantageous driver mutations;
                   however, genetic instability can also potentially
                   retard tumour growth by increasing the rate of
                   deleterious mutation. As such, it is unclear whether
                   genetically unstable clones would tend to be more
                   selectively advantageous than their genetically
                   stable counterparts within a growing tumour. Here, we
                   show the circumstances where genetic instability
                   evolves during tumour progression towards cancer. We
                   employ a Wright-Fisher type model that describes the
                   evolution of tumour subclones. Clones can acquire
                   both advantageous and deleterious mutations, and
                   mutator mutations that increase a cell's intrinsic
                   mutation rate. Within the model, cancers evolve with
                   a mutator phenotype when driver mutations bestow only
                   moderate increases in fitness: very strong or weak
                   selection for driver mutations suppresses the
                   evolution of a mutator phenotype. Genetic instability
                   occurs secondarily to selectively advantageous driver
                   mutations. Deleterious mutations have relatively
                   little effect on the evolution of genetic instability
                   unless selection for additional driver mutations is
                   very weak or if deleterious mutations are very
                   common. Our model provides a framework for studying
                   the evolution of genetic instability in tumour
                   progression. Our analysis highlights the central role
                   of selection in shaping patterns of mutation in

                   the temporal or even causal order between
                   aberrations, and the involved pathways. Here we
                   present network models for chromosomal aberrations
                   and algorithms for training models based on observed
                   data. Our models are generative probabilistic models
                   that can be used to study dynamical aspects of

                   suited for a graphical representation that conveys

                   performs very well with respect to several measures
                   of goodness of fit and is, with respect to repetition

                   for much larger sets of genes than previously

                   a multi-type branching process: we model individual
                   cells which can either divide or undergo apoptosis.
                   In the case of a cell division, the two daughter
                   cells can mutate, which potentially confers a change
                   in fitness to the cell. In contrast to previous
                   models, the change in fitness induced by the driver
                   mutation depends on the genetic context of the cell,
                   in our case on the number of passenger mutations. The
                   passenger mutations themselves have no or only a very

                   Lymphoma. In this tumor, the hallmark mutation leads
                   to deregulation of the MYC oncogene which increases
                   the rate of apoptosis, but also the proliferation
                   rate of cells. This increase in the rate of apoptosis
                   hence needs to be overcome by mutations affecting
                   apoptotic pathways, naturally leading to an epistatic
                   fitness landscape. This model shows a very
                   interesting dynamical behavior which is distinct from
                   the dynamics of cancer initiation in the absence of
                   epistasis. Since the driver mutation is deleterious
                   to a cell with only a few passenger mutations, there
                   is a period of stasis in the number of cells until a
                   clone of cells with enough passenger mutations
                   emerges. Only when the driver mutation occurs in one
                   of those cells, the cell population starts to grow
                   rapidly. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract =      {Complex traits often involve interactions between
                   different genetic loci. This can lead to sign
                   epistasis, whereby mutations that are individually
                   deleterious or neutral combine to confer a fitness
                   benefit. In order to acquire the beneficial genotype,
                   an asexual population must cross a fitness valley or
                   plateau by first acquiring the deleterious or neutral
                   intermediates. Here, we present a complete, intuitive
                   theoretical description of the valley-crossing
                   process across the full spectrum of possible
                   parameter regimes. We calculate the rate at which a
                   population crosses a fitness valley or plateau of
                   arbitrary width, as a function of the mutation rates,
                   the population size, and the fitnesses of the
                   intermediates. We find that when intermediates are
                   close to neutral, a large population can cross even
                   wide fitness valleys remarkably quickly, so that
                   valley-crossing dynamics may be common even when
                   mutations that directly increase fitness are also
                   possible. Thus the evolutionary dynamics of large
                   populations can be sensitive to the structure of an
                   extended region of the fitness landscape - the
                   population may not take directly uphill paths in
                   favor of paths across valleys and plateaus that lead
                   eventually to fitter genotypes. In smaller
                   populations, we find that below a threshold size,
                   which depends on the width of the fitness valley and
                   the strength of selection against intermediate
                   genotypes, valley-crossing is much less likely and
                   hence the evolutionary dynamics are less influenced
                   by distant regions of the fitness landscape. ?? 2009
