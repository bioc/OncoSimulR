                   laboratory method to measure gains and losses of
                   chromosomal regions in tumor cells. It is believed
                   that DNA gains and losses in tumor cells do not occur
                   entirely at random, but partly through some flow of
                   causality. Models that relate tumor progression to
                   the occurrence of DNA gains and losses could be very
                   useful in hunting cancer genes and in cancer
                   diagnosis. We lay some mathematical foundations for
                   inferring a model of tumor progression from a CGH
                   data set. We consider a class of tree models that are
                   more general than a path model that has been
                   developed for colorectal cancer. We derive a tree
                   model inference algorithm based on the idea of a
                   maximum-weight branching in a graph, and we show that
                   under plausible assumptions our algorithm infers the
                   correct tree. We have implemented our methods in
                   software, and we illustrate with a CGH data set for

                   characterized by accumulating mutations. However, the
                   precise timing and the order of genetic alterations
                   that drive tumor progression remain enigmatic.
                   RESULTS: We present a specific probabilistic
                   graphical model for the accumulation of mutations and
                   their interdependencies. The Bayesian network models
                   cancer progression by an explicit unobservable
                   accumulation process in time that is separated from
                   the observable but error-prone detection of
                   mutations. Model parameters are estimated by an
                   Expectation-Maximization algorithm and the underlying
                   interaction graph is obtained by a simulated
                   annealing procedure. Applying this method to
                   cytogenetic data for different cancer types, we find
                   multiple complex oncogenetic pathways deviating
                   substantially from simplified models, such as linear
                   pathways or trees. We further demonstrate how the
                   inferred progression dynamics can be used to improve
                   genetics-based survival predictions which could
                   support diagnostics and prognosis. AVAILABILITY: The

                   dynamics can only be addressed through simulations.
                   However, accurate simulations of realistically large
                   populations over long periods of time needed for
                   evolution to proceed are computationally expensive.
                   Mutant can be present in very small numbers and yet
                   (if they are more fit than others) be the key part of
                   the evolutionary process. This leads to significant
                   stochasticity that needs to be accounted for.
                   Different evolutionary events occur at very different
                   time scales: mutations are typically much rarer than
                   reproduction and deaths. RESULTS: We introduce a new
                   exact algorithm for fast fully stochastic simulations
                   of evolutionary dynamics that include birth, death,
                   and mutation events. It produces a significant
                   speedup compared to the direct stochastic simulations
                   in a typical case when the population size is large
                   and the mutation rates are much smaller than birth
                   and death rates. The algorithm performance is
                   illustrated by several examples that include
                   evolution on a smooth and rugged fitness landscape.
                   We also show how this algorithm can be adapted for
                   approximate simulations of more complex evolutionary
                   problems and illustrate it by simulations of a
                   stochastic competitive growth model. CONTACT:

  abstract =      {Major efforts to sequence cancer genomes are now
                   occurring throughout the world. Though the emerging
                   data from these studies are illuminating, their
                   reconciliation with epidemiologic and clinical
                   observations poses a major challenge. In the current
                   study, we provide a mathematical model that begins to
                   address this challenge. We model tumors as a discrete
                   time branching process that starts with a single
                   driver mutation and proceeds as each new driver
                   mutation leads to a slightly increased rate of clonal
                   expansion. Using the model, we observe tremendous
                   variation in the rate of tumor development-providing
                   an understanding of the heterogeneity in tumor sizes
                   and development times that have been observed by
                   epidemiologists and clinicians. Furthermore, the
                   model provides a simple formula for the number of
                   driver mutations as a function of the total number of
                   mutations in the tumor. Finally, when applied to
                   recent experimental data, the model allows us to
                   calculate the actual selective advantage provided by
                   typical somatic mutations in human tumors in situ.
                   This selective advantage is surprisingly small-0.004
                   ± 0.0004-and has major implications for experimental
                   cancer research.},

  abstract =      {Cancer progression is driven by the accumulation of a
                   small number of genetic alterations. However, these
                   few driver alterations reside in a cancer genome
                   alongside tens of thousands of additional mutations
                   termed passengers. Passengers are widely believed to
                   have no role in cancer, yet many passengers fall
                   within protein-coding genes and other functional
                   elements that can have potentially deleterious
                   effects on cancer cells. Here we investigate the
                   potential of moderately deleterious passengers to
                   accumulate and alter the course of neoplastic
                   progression. Our approach combines evolutionary
                   simulations of cancer progression with an analysis of
                   cancer sequencing data. From simulations, we find
                   that passengers accumulate and largely evade natural
                   selection during progression. Although individually
                   weak, the collective burden of passengers alters the
                   course of progression, leading to several oncological
                   phenomena that are hard to explain with a traditional
                   driver-centric view. We then tested the predictions
                   of our model using cancer genomics data and confirmed
                   that many passengers are likely damaging and have
                   largely evaded negative selection. Finally, we use
                   our model to explore cancer treatments that exploit
                   the load of passengers by either (i) increasing the
                   mutation rate or (ii) exacerbating their deleterious
                   effects. Though both approaches lead to cancer
                   regression, the latter is a more effective therapy.
                   Our results suggest a unique framework for
                   understanding cancer progression as a balance of
                   driver and passenger mutations.},
